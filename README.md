# Christendom Budgeting

This is a standalone static web app for Christendom Budgeting.

It uses:

- Plain HTML
- Plain CSS
- Plain JavaScript
- SQL.js in the browser
- GitHub as the database storage/sync backend

It does not use Node.js, npm, React, a server, paid hosting, firewall ports, or direct access to a local Windows file.

## What It Edits

The web app downloads, opens, edits, and uploads:

```text
budget.sqlite3
```

from the selected GitHub repository and branch.

The Windows app can still use the same file by syncing with GitHub, but the web app no longer depends on the Windows app for daily entry.

## New User GitHub Sync Setup

To test without GitHub first, open the app and tap `Try Demo Without GitHub`. Demo mode creates a sample budget in this browser only. It does not upload anything and it can be cleared from `Settings`.

1. Put these files on GitHub Pages:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `app.js`
2. Open the published GitHub Pages URL.
3. Create or sign in to a GitHub account.
4. Create a private repository, for example `christendom-budget-sync`.
5. Create a fine-grained personal access token for only that repository.
6. Give the token `Contents: Read and write` permission.
7. Paste the token into Christendom Budgeting.
8. Tap `Load Repositories`.
9. Choose the repository from the dropdown.
10. Choose the branch from the dropdown, usually `main`.
11. Tap `Open Database`.

Christendom Budgeting stores `budget.sqlite3` at the root of the selected branch.

The fine-grained token needs:

- Access only to the private budget backup repo
- `Contents: Read and write`

## Daily Use

The first screen after loading is `Add`, because transaction entry is the focus.

Adding a transaction:

1. Enter the amount.
2. Choose expense/income.
3. Choose account and category.
4. Optionally add vendor and notes.
5. Tap `Save Transaction`.

Christendom Budgeting saves the transaction into SQLite and uploads the updated `budget.sqlite3` to GitHub.

Budgeting:

1. Open `Budgets`.
2. Enter expected income for the month.
3. Allocate that income across expense, savings, giving, debt, and other categories.
4. Keep allocating until `Left To Allocate` is `$0.00`.

Debt payments are added to the monthly budget automatically. The app sets the `Debt`
allocation to the total of all tracked debts' minimum plus extra payments.

The budget is green when every dollar is assigned and red while money is still unallocated or overallocated.

Debt tracking:

1. Add each debt in the `Debts` tab with its balance, interest rate, minimum payment, and extra payment.
2. When recording a debt payment transaction, choose the matching debt in `Linked Debt`.
3. Linked debt expense transactions reduce that debt's tracked balance.
4. Editing or deleting a linked transaction reverses the old balance impact before applying the new one.

## Conflict Handling

The web app uploads the entire SQLite database file.

If GitHub says the database changed since the web app loaded it, saving fails with a conflict message. Use `Reload From GitHub`, then make the change again.

Avoid editing in the Windows app and web app at the exact same time.

## Reset

To clear saved browser settings, open:

```text
https://your-pages-url/?reset=1
```

or use `Clear Web Settings` in the Settings tab.

## Security Note

The GitHub token is stored in this browser's `localStorage`. Use a private repo and a token limited to that repo.
